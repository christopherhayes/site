<h1> Christopher Hayes </h1>

<p> I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the mathematics program at my alma mater, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallaudet_University">Gallaudet University</a>. I'll make this website more attractive eventually... </p>


<h2> Information </h2>

<p>Email: christopher dot hayes at gallaudet dot edu </p>

<p> Office: Hall Memorial Building S340H</p>

<p> Education: PhD Mathematics, University of Connecticut; MA Mathematics, The George Washington University; BS Mathematics, Gallaudet University</p> 

<p> Research Interests: I am studying analysis on fractals. More specifically, I study resistance scaling and Dirichlet forms on infinitely ramified fractals such as the Sierpinski Carpet. My PhD advisor was <a href="http://www.math.uconn.edu/~rogers/">Luke Rogers</a>. For my master's I mostly studied knot theory and some computability theory. I am also interested in mathematics education, particularly the education of deaf students. Outside of math I like linguistics, economics, and history. </p>

*There is a mistake on the second slide. The Mandelbrot set is not technically a Julia set. Also, the contraction ratio for the octacarpet is actually 1 - 1/Sqrt[2].
