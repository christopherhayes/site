<h2> Extra Stuff </h2>

<hr>

<p> I am happy to sign with anyone on campus for practice or socialization during lunch or for coffee or something. Feel free to reach out or visit my office. </p>

<p> I highly recommend the website <a href="http://www.lifeprint.com/" target="_blank">Lifeprint</a> for ASL study and practice. The name is really bad, but it's a great site and I can confirm that the creator Dr. Bill Vicars is bona-fide fluent. Not all ASL education sites / YouTube videos are made by fluent signers, so watch out. For daily news in ASL I recommend <a href="http://www.dailymoth.com/">The Daily Moth</a>, I think he is good for intermediate ASL students; a natural but calm pace and a very clear signer.   </p>

<p> I <i>love</i> traditional card games as well as the history of such games and playing cards themselves. If your home area or family play an interesting game I would like to know about it. I mostly enjoy trick-taking games, particularly the general family of Ace-Ten games. Feel free to visit or reach out to play any game, including my top favorites:

<ul>
	<li> <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skat_(card_game)> Skat </a> <!-- (In Hartford we play international rules plus kontra/re, and bockrunde after 60-60, lost kontras, any games over 100 points, and grand hands.) --> </li>
	<li> Schnapsen / 66</li>
	<li> Pinochle <!--(I am familiar with all forms. For Partnership Auction Pinochle I usually play single-deck Modern scoring with Pass 2.) --> </li>

	<li> Spades </li> <!--(Usually plain "Trick" Spades but will play "Book" Spades with jokers/deuces, 10-for-200, 4-minimum, etc.) -->
			
	<li> Euchre </li>
	
	
</ul>



<p> If you play Go (aka Baduk or Weiqi) I love to play and have a set at my desk. Ask for a game if you'd like. My favorite player is <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChoChikun" target="_blank">Cho Chikun</a>.</p> (Update Nov. 2018: I still like the game but have not played regularly for a while and am very rusty.) (Update Jan. 2021: I took the game up again.)

<p> I highly recommend <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/">Paul's Online Notes</a> for reviewing all fundamental undergraduate math concepts (algebra through multivariable calculus). </p>
