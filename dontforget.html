Here is a short poem (or song, I guess) that I wrote so that people do not mess up my email address, christopher.k.hayes@uconn.edu

<h2>Don't Forget the K</h2>

<p> Don't forget the K <br />
In the middle of my name<br />
If you send an email to<br />
Christopher Hayes<br />
You'll wait many days<br />
And then finally say<br />
Did you get it, Mr. Hayes?<br />
<br />
Then I'll just say,<br />
You forgot the K<br />
You forgot the K<br />
Okay?<br />
<br />
I had a student once<br />
Who emailed me every month<br />
Who'd apparently say<br />
Help me, Mr. Hayes<br />
Help me, Mr. Hayes<br />
Sadly I must say<br />
I didn't help a single day!<br />
<br />
If you send email my way<br />
Don't forget the K<br />
Don't forget the K<br />
Okay?<br />
<br />
My email is not<br />
Christopher dot<br />
Then my last name Hayes<br />
In between there's a K<br />
Christopher dot<br />
Then a K and a dot<br />
And finally Hayes!<br />
<br />
When you type in my name<br />
Don't forget the K<br />
Don't forget the K<br />
Okay?<br />
</p>
